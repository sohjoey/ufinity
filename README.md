NodeJs Assessment

1. As a teacher, I want to register one or more students to a specified teacher.
A teacher can register multiple students. A student can also be registered to multiple teachers.
This API should create the teacher and students if they do not already exist in the system.
* Endpoint: POST /api/register
* Headers: Content-Type: application/json
* Success response status: HTTP 204
* Request body example:
{
"teacher": "teacherken@gmail.com"
"students":
[
"studentjon@example.com",
"studenthon@example.com"
]
}
2. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students common to a given list of teachers (i.e. retrieve
students who are registered to ALL of the given teachers).
* Endpoint: GET /api/commonstudents
* Success response status: HTTP 200
* Request example 1: GET /api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken%40example.com
* Success response body 1:
{
"students" :
[
"commonstudent1@gmail.com",
"commonstudent2@gmail.com",
"student_only_under_teacher_ken@gmail.com"
]
}
* Request example 2: GET
/api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken%40example.com&teacher=teacherjoe%40example.com
* Success response body 2:
{
 "students" :
[
"commonstudent1@gmail.com",
"commonstudent2@gmail.com"
]
}
3. As a teacher, I want to suspend a specified student.
* Endpoint: POST /api/suspend
* Headers: Content-Type: application/json
* Success response status: HTTP 204
* Request body example:
{
"student" : "studentmary@gmail.com"
}
4. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students who can receive a given notification.
A notification consists of:
* the teacher who is sending the notification, and
* the text of the notification itself.
To receive notifications from e.g. 'teacherken@example.com', a student:
* MUST NOT be suspended,
* AND MUST fulfill AT LEAST ONE of the following:
i. is registered with â€œteacherken@example.com"
ii. has been @mentioned in the notification
The list of students retrieved should not contain any duplicates/repetitions.
* Endpoint: POST /api/retrievefornotifications
* Headers: Content-Type: application/json
* Success response status: HTTP 200
* Request body example 1:
{
"teacher": "teacherken@example.com",
"notification": "Hello students! @studentagnes@example.com
@studentmiche@example.com"
}
* Success response body 1:
{
 "recipients":
[
"studentbob@example.com",
"studentagnes@example.com",
"studentmiche@example.com"
]
}
In the example above, studentagnes@example.com and studentmiche@example.com can receive the
notification from teacherken@example.com, regardless whether they are registered to him, because
they are @mentioned in the notification text. studentbob@example.com however, has to be registered
to teacherken@example.com.
* Request body example 2:
{
"teacher": "teacherken@example.com",
"notification": "Hey everybody"
}
* Success response body 2:
{
"recipients":
[
"studentbob@example.com",
]
}
Error Responses
For all the above API endpoints, error responses should:
* have an appropriate HTTP response code
* have a JSON response body containing a meaningful error message:
{ "message": "Some meaningful error message" }
